                            To accomplish this, in my opinion, there are three key points to consider:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <span className='fw-bold'>Know-what:</span> It is crucial to understand what AI is and how developers interact with it at a code level. This ensure gaining knowledge about the inner workings of AI systems.
                            </li>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span className='fw-bold'>Know-how:</span> By mastering the first two points, we can begin to establish regulations or boundaries that are universally understood and accepted.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            It is important to understand the ever-changing world and redefining educational principles to cope with new sophisticated challenges we are currently facing.

                        <h4>Robotics Ruls for Human</h4>
                        <p>
                            The core element revolves around control, and those who possess it can govern and shape the course of events. While humans in positions of control may occasionally make mistakes, the situation may differ when it comes to AI and its sophisticated problem-solving abilities. The one with the most reliable decision-making pattern can eventually determine the outcome of matters that hold utmost importance to humans, such as the value of things and the establishment of rules.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, let's envision a world without traditional rules, and for that, I would like to propose three rules of robotics and convert them into three rules for humans:
                            <br />First attempt:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Individuals must comply with and respect the autonomy and well-being of others.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Individuals must avoid actions or situations that may physically or psychologically harm other humans.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Within their domain, individuals are free to act as they wish as long as their actions align with the principles outlined in the first and second laws.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            My first attempt to build on the idea of exploiting the concept of control and decision making in a world where AI plays a significant role sounds good enough for me. Now, bear in mind that you should shift your mindset to understand this vision. It may not appear practical, but think about a world without any authoritarian force, where humans simply live side by side in a world that caters to all human needs.                        </p>

                            When we are deeply committed to creating a society that can fulfill the requirements of decent living for everyone, people will shift their mindset from working to live or working to get rich to instead enjoying living. The focus of creativity will also shift towards exploring how to prolong life and determining the best practices for enhancing human well-being. In this transformed society, relationships will also undergo change, consequently significantly altering the need for having multiple children. By taking this vision further and imagine a utopian society where the focus shifts from working form material gain to enjoying life and exploring ways to enhance human well-being.
